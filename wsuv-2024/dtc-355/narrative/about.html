					This project was created as part of the required coursework for certification, covering a timeline of events that affected natural language processing. Information regarding this subject and sources involved were collected and summarized using Google Gemini AI.
				</p>

				<p>
					While the project turned out well, it was not without roadblocks. Among the largest challenges was understanding appropriate color combinations and hierarchy throughout the project. The initial hierarchy featured a grid of detail tags, which proved counterintuitive during a peer review. The original color palette also included colors that did not mesh well, and it was concluded that these colors should not be kept in. Besides this, there was concern that the original typescript used was not appropriate, but that was quickly resolved. These bumps in progress brought about important lessons in analyzing the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the project, it was clear that there were things I did not know previously. Even though it was removed from the project, I learned how to format details elements in a two-column grid. I also learned how to hide image elements using @media queries for screen size. Besides this, proper analysis of the project as a whole became very important for polishing the website design. Although these are the main takeaways, there are other things that I learned during the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not everything could be resolved immediately, however. My choice in colors was poorly decided and could have been chosen more carefully. Besides this, the initial design ignored the subject of the project, emphasizing a need to think about what would fit best with the subject. This may not encompass all the areas to work on, but it is important to recognize the problem.
