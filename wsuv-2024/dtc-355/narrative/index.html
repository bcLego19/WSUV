				<p>
					Born in London, England, on June 23rd, 1912, Alan Turing is considered one of the most influential figures in computer science and artificial intelligence. After World War II, where he cracked the Enigma code, he published several papers including "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in 1950. In this paper, he proposed the Turing Test as a way of determining whether a machine could think. The test consists of a human judge interacting with a machine and a human through a computer terminal. It theorized that a machine is considered "intelligent" if the human judge cannot distinguish between the machine and the human. While he did continue work on artificial intelligence after the war, Turing committed suicide in 1954 at the age of 41.
