					Time management is the process of planning and controlling the time spent on your tasks to improve your efficiency. Managing your time is also associated with relieving stress, increasing free time, and creating more opportunities. It can also be useful for employers, as good time management can lead to happier employees, improved creativity, lower absenteeism, and lower turnover. When you have good time management, the benefits can be enormous for both people and employers.
				</p>

				<p>
					To have good time management, you need to know how to control your time and set relevant goals. There are several different ways to accomplish time management goals. The following is a list of some of the ways you can take control of your time.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Know how you're spending your time
					</li>
					<li>
						Stick to a daily schedule
					</li>
					<li>
						Prioritize tasks
					</li>
					<li>
						Automate repetitive tasks
					</li>
					<li>
						Tackle the most difficult task first
					</li>
					<li>
						Batch-process similar tasks
					</li>
					<li>
						Put AI to work for search and summaries
					</li>
					<li>
						Set reasonable time limits
					</li>
					<li>
						Learn when to say no
					</li>
					<li>
						Avoid multitasking
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep things organized
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					This is not an all-inclusive list, as there are other ways to manage your time. For example, timeboxing involves breaking large tasks into smaller pieces, assigning each piece a set time to do it in. Another useful method is SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound), which help you visualize realistic tasks that you can complete efficiently and quickly. In addition, gathering points is a method to help you keep things organized so that tasks can be resolved faster. As you can see, there are many different ways to effectively accomplish time management.
